For me, wireframes aren’t just boxes on a canvas—they’re blueprints for how people think and interact. I focus on mapping mental models, understanding the psychology and ergonomics behind every decision, and translating that into interfaces that feel intuitive. Whether it’s an early sketch or a refined flow, my wireframes are tools to align teams, test assumptions, and make sure the user’s perspective stays at the core of the process.
