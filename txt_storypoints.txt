Design doesn’t happen in a vacuum—it needs rhythm and structure. I’ve worked inside agile frameworks where story points, Q-gates, and release milestones define the pace. For me, project management is about more than deadlines: it’s about creating clarity, making trade-offs visible, and keeping teams aligned on outcomes. This balance between creativity and delivery has been key to turning concepts into real, shipped products.
