My 3D background adds a layer of craft that most UX designers don’t bring to the table. From precise NURBS modeling to polygon workflows, I’ve built everything from concept visualizations to motion graphics. This skillset sharpens how I think about form, space, and movement—not only for visuals, but also for how digital products feel when they animate, transition, and respond.
