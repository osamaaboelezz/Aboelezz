I’ve spent years building design systems that go far beyond the basics—scalable frameworks that work seamlessly across touchpoints, platforms, and interaction modes. My work bridges designers, developers, and project managers, ensuring each group has the structure and clarity they need. I’ve developed sophisticated token and variable architectures, even linking them directly into Android Automotive pipelines to streamline CI/CD workflows.
