I’ve spent years building design systems that go far beyond the basics—scalable frameworks that work seamlessly across touchpoints, platforms, and interaction modes. My work bridges designers, developers, and project managers, ensuring each group has the structure and clarity they need. These systems have supported high-volume automotive programs over multiple release cycles and are tightly integrated into streamlined CI/CD workflows powering vehicles in global production today.
